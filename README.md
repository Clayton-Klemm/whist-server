# Project Name: whist-server

## Introduction
This project is inspired by Joel Niklaus's work on "JassTheRipper" as well as the paper on "AlphaHoldem" by Enmin Zhao, Renye Yan, Jinqiu Li, Kai Li, and Junliang Xing. My aim is to develop a Spring Boot server dedicated to researching AI strategies in card games, with a particular focus on the game of Minnesota Whist.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Server Functionalities
- [x] Initialize Spring Boot server environment.
- [ ] Incorporate core server functionalities.
- [ ] Explore and implement session management strategies in Spring Boot.

### Phase 2: Crafting Game Logic
- [ ] Develop the game logic.
- [ ] Make the game playable by human players first
- [ ] Test and debug the game logic.

### Phase 3: AI Development and Experimentation
- [ ] Develop baseline AI that inherits player.java class abilities and plays cards at random.
- [ ] Develop a rule-based AI that plays cards based upon hardcoded rule set.
- [ ] Develop a trained AI that uses Monty carlo tree search machine learing strategy.
- [ ] Conduct extensive AI performance testing and optimization.

### Phase 4: Documentation and Enhancement
- [ ] Develop detailed documentation covering all aspects of the project.
- [ ] Refine and optimize code, algorithms, and server performance.
- [ ] Focus on scalability, security, and efficiency improvements.

### Phase 5: Research Analysis and Dissemination
- [ ] Utilize the platform for in-depth AI card game strategy research.
- [ ] Analyze research data and derive meaningful insights.
- [ ] Prepare and share research findings through publications or presentations.

## Contributing
I am very new to Java Spring Boot and game development in general if you have any constructive criticisms I would be **very** greatful!
