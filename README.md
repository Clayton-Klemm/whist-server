# Project Name: whist-server

## Introduction
This project is inspired by Joel Niklaus's work on "JassTheRipper" and the paper "AlphaHoldem" by Enmin Zhao, Renye Yan, Jinqiu Li, Kai Li, and Junliang Xing. My aim is to develop a Spring Boot server dedicated to researching AI strategies in card games, focusing particularly on the game of Minnesota Whist.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Server Functionalities
- [x] Initialize Spring Boot server environment.
- [ ] Incorporate core server functionalities.
- [ ] Explore and implement session management strategies in Spring Boot.

### Phase 2: Crafting Game Logic
- [ ] Develop the game logic.
- [ ] Make the game playable by human players first.
- [ ] Test and debug the game logic.

### Phase 3: AI Development and Experimentation
- [ ] Develop a baseline AI that inherits abilities from the player.java class and plays cards randomly.
- [ ] Develop a rule-based AI that plays cards based on a hardcoded rule set.
- [ ] Develop a trained AI using the Monte Carlo tree search machine learning strategy.
- [ ] Conduct extensive AI performance testing and optimization.

### Phase 4: Documentation and Enhancement
- [ ] Develop detailed documentation covering all aspects of the project.
- [ ] Refine and optimize code, algorithms, and server performance.
- [ ] Focus on scalability, security, and efficiency improvements.

### Phase 5: Research Analysis and Dissemination
- [ ] Utilize the platform for in-depth AI card game strategy research.
- [ ] Analyze research data and derive meaningful insights.
- [ ] Prepare and share research findings through publications or presentations.

## Contributing
As I am very new to Java Spring Boot and game development, any constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated!
